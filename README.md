# Bezrealitky.cz Web Scraping
In this web scraping project, I utilize the Beautiful Soup library for Python. 
My objective is to gather structured data from the first 3 pages in https://www.bezrealitky.cz/ and store it in Pandas DataFrame for further analysis or processing.
The data that was acquired through web scraping:
1) Location (districts and streets), 
2) Number of rooms (room_num),
3) Open-Plan Kitchen, kk or +1 (is_studio),
4) Rent price (prices),
5) Additional fees (fees)

Performed data cleaning operations to remove unwanted characters, whitespace, or HTML tags.
