# Bezrealitky.cz Web Scraping
In this web scraping project, I utilize the Beautiful Soup library for Python. 
My objective is to gather structured data from https://www.bezrealitky.cz/ and store it in a CSV file for further analysis or processing using Pandas.
The data that was acquired through web scraping:
1) Location (district and street), 
2) Number of rooms (room),
3) Area of the apartment (area)
4) Rent price (price),
5) Additional fees (fee)
